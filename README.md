# mythaeonnox
Theme for MythTV based on Aeon Nox
This theme is based on, and inspired by, the original XBMC skin called Aeon Nox by BigNoid. 
The theme looks best with the included menu called 'MythAeon' as this menu lay-out and items are tailored for this particular theme.

Mythaeon supports the following plugins:

    MythMusic
    MythBrowser
    MythNetvision
    MythWeather
    MythNews
    MythGallery
    MythArchive
    MythGame
    MythZoneminder

There are no plans to extent the support for this theme to other MythTV plugins than mentioned above.
